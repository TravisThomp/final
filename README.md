Final Project - Climbing Route Visualization
===
Website: https://travisthomp.github.io/final/dist/index.html

This was created using React and D3, all the rest of the code was written by me.

This project is a visualization of climber's hold choices on a route. The user is able to select which climbers they want to view and also play and skim their movement.

### Project Screen-Cast

Each team will create a two minute screen-cast with narration showing a demo of your visualization and/or some slides. 

You can use any screencast tool of your choice, such as Camtasia or Loom (new and recommended). 
Please make sure that the sound quality of your video is good -- it may be worthwhile to invest in an external USB microphone-- campus IT should have some you can borrow. 
Upload the video to an online video-platform such as YouTube or Vimeo and embed it into your project web page. 
For our final project presentation day, we will show as many videos in class as possible, and ask teams to field questions.

We will strictly enforce the two minute time limit for the video, so please make sure you are not running longer. 
Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your screencast on your main contributions rather than on technical details. 
What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
What insights did you gain? 
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is front and center rather than at the end.
